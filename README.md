# Shul Groups Signup

This webapp allows for events to be created and managed, add groups to those 
events and allows for people to signup for a group in that event

This system was developed for the young israel of west hempstead but could easily
be adapted for another group

A url like a Google form can be added for more customized events that can't use
the signup questions on the site
